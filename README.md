#  Smart Attendance System Using Face Recognition

A computer vision project that automatically marks attendance by recognizing faces through a webcam — no manual roll calls needed.

---

##  What It Does

- Registers faces of people (students / employees) using their webcam photo
- Detects and recognizes faces in real time using the laptop camera
- Automatically marks attendance in a CSV file with name, date, and time
- Prevents duplicate entries — each person is marked only once per day
- Lets you view attendance records filtered by date or name

##  Installation

### 1. Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed
Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### 2. Install required libraries
Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
```bash
pip install cmake
pip install dlib
pip install face_recognition
pip install opencv-python
```

>  `dlib` requires Visual Studio Build Tools on Windows. See [dlib install guide](http://dlib.net/compile.html) if you face issues.

##  How to Use

### Step 1 — Register a Person
```bash
python register.py
```
- A webcam window opens
- Enter the person's name when prompted
- Press **SPACE** to capture and save the photo
- Repeat for each person

No webcam or display available? Register from an existing photo instead:
```bash
python register.py --name Alice --photo path/to/alice.jpg
```

### Step 2 — Run Attendance
```bash
python attendance.py
```
- The webcam opens and starts recognizing faces
- A green box appears around recognized faces with a ✓ checkmark
- Attendance is saved automatically to `attendance.csv`
- Press **Q** to stop

No display server (e.g. running on a headless machine)? Skip the preview window:
```bash
python attendance.py --no-display --max-frames 100
```

No webcam at all? Run against a folder of test photos instead — this exercises
the same detection/matching/CSV-logging logic without needing a camera:
```bash
python attendance.py --image-folder test_images
```

### Step 3 — View Attendance
```bash
# See all records
python view_attendance.py

# See only today's attendance
python view_attendance.py --today

# See records for a specific person
python view_attendance.py --name Alice
```

##  Sample Output (attendance.csv)

| Name  | Date       | Time     | Status  |
|-------|------------|----------|---------|
| Alice | 2025-06-10 | 09:05:32 | Present |
| Bob   | 2025-06-10 | 09:07:15 | Present |
| Alice | 2025-06-11 | 08:58:44 | Present |

##  How It Works (Technical Overview)

1. **Face Registration** — Captures a photo and saves it to `known_faces/`
2. **Encoding** — `face_recognition` converts each photo into a 128-point numerical "fingerprint"
3. **Real-time Detection** — OpenCV reads webcam frames; `face_recognition` locates faces in each frame
4. **Matching** — The system compares detected face encodings with stored encodings using Euclidean distance
5. **Attendance Logging** — On a match below the confidence threshold, the name + timestamp is written to CSV

##  Configuration

In `attendance.py`, you can change:
```python
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.55  # Lower = stricter matching (default: 0.55)
```
